Boost binaries are not included in this repository.

The Boost library archive is very large (~250 MB), which makes it
impractical to distribute alongside the other binaries in this project.

To obtain the required version of Boost, please download the official
archive from the Boost website:

https://www.boost.org/users/download/

This project was tested with:
  Boost version: 1.90.0

If you already have the Boost archive locally, the original file used
during development was:

  boost_1_90_0.zip

After downloading, extract Boost and configure your build or environment
accordingly.
